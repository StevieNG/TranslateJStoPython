    ========== README ============

    Hi. Below is something I wrote to convert a CSV file into JSON.

    Please open this file in a web browser, and upload the data.csv file to see it in action.

    Once you've added the file, it will download two .json files, and also log their output in the browser console (press F12 to view) 

    It would be cool if you could convert some/all of this into a similar Python function.

    I have added comments below to help you understand what's happening. 

    The first few things are very specific to a web browser solution so you can largely ignore them, 
    the part we want converting is titled "THE MAIN PART", although it's useful to read through the other parts anyway.

    Any questions please email me on greg.ellis@resulting-it.com

<!-- 
    We need to be able to access the CSV file.
    In javascript we can do this via using the browser as a UI and adding the input element below. 
    The 'a' element is just for us to trigger the download later, you will not have either in Python.
    (In python you may need to have the CSV somewhere it can locate, i.e. on the same server, or a public url etc)

--> 
<input type="file" id="files"> 
<a href="#" id="downloadAnchorElem">
 
<!--
    We then need to convert each line in the CSV to a JavaScript object.
    Fortunately there's an existing javascript library which handles this for us, so we will include that here to use later.
    (In python you may write a csv to object function, or find an existing library to use)

/**
 * 
 *  You can largely ignore this first function because it is very specific to a javascript/browser solution.
 *  
 *  You may need something similar in Python to initiate the other function running but it would not be similar at all.
 *
 *  I will explain what this does anyway:
 * 
 *  1. It detects the input field being changed (when you add a csv to it)
 *  2. It runs the "csv to objects" function on the CSV file, so that we now have an array of objects to work with
 *  3. It passes those objects to the main function, which is what you'll be re-writing :)
 *

  var files = evt.target.files; // FileList object
  var file = files[0];
  var reader = new FileReader();
  reader.readAsText(file);
  reader.onload = function(event){
    var csv = event.target.result;
    objects = $.csv.toObjects(csv);
    // console.log(objects);
    csvObjectsToCollections(objects);
  }

    alert('Unable to read ' + file.fileName);

/**
 * 
 *  THE MAIN PART
 * 
 *  Well done, you've read this far! 
 * 
 *  This is the main function which we would like a python version of.
 * 
 *  1. It takes the array of objects that we get from the first function
 *  2. It loops through those objects, and for each of their properties creates a 'node'
 *  3. If the object has multiple properties, it also creates an 'edge' between those nodes
 * 
 *  The object we will loop through
 *  {Level1: A, Level2: B}
 * 
 *  Create this 'nodes' json:
 *  [{name: A},{name: B}]
 *  
 *  And create this 'edge' json:
 *  [{from: A, to: B}]
 * 
 *  The rows in the test file you are uploading has 5 levels, {Level1: A, Level2: B, Level3: C, Level4: D, Level5: E}
 * 
 *  So in our loop, we check for upto 5 levels of nodes.
 *
